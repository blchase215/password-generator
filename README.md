# Password Generator

## Description

  An app that generates a password for the user.  The password will be of a length, and character content, that is chosen by the user.

## Note:

  For extra security, passwords will always contain **_at least one of each_** _character type chosen_, and have a **minimum** length of **8** characters.  This app will generate a password with a **maximum** length of **128** characters.

## Usage

The user answers a series of promps, choosing a **Password Length**, of **8-128** characters, and then choosing which character sets to include, from: 
1. alphabetic **Lowercase**:..... a-z
2. alphabetic **Uppercase**:..... A-Z
3. **Numeric** values:.................. 0-9, and
4. **Spec Characters**: 
! "#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@ \[ \\ \]^_`{|}~

When all choices are made, the user's bespoke, randomized, secure password is generated and displayed.
